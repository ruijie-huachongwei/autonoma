title: Environment Variables
description: Complete reference for every environment variable used across the Autonoma AI monorepo - API server, frontend, AI services, database, storage, logging, billing, and infrastructure.
---

## Quick Start - Minimum for Local Development

To get the API and UI running locally, you need a surprisingly small set of variables. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` at the repo root and fill in these essentials:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/autonoma

# Redis
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# API server
API_PORT=4000
SCENARIO_ENCRYPTION_KEY=any-string-at-least-1-char

# Google OAuth (create credentials at console.cloud.google.com)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret

# GitHub OAuth (optional - create an OAuth app at github.com/settings/developers)
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-oauth-client-id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-github-oauth-client-secret

# Built-in AI providers (needed for test execution)
AI_PROVIDER=builtin
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-key
GROQ_KEY=your-groq-key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-key

# S3-compatible storage (can use MinIO locally)
S3_BUCKET=autonoma-local
S3_REGION=us-east-1
S3_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9000
S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=true
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=minioadmin
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=minioadmin
```

Everything else has sensible defaults or is optional for local development. The sections below cover every variable in detail.

## How Environment Variables Work in This Project

Every app and package defines its environment variables in a dedicated `env.ts` file using [`createEnv` from `@t3-oss/env-core`](https://env.t3.gg/). This gives you:

- **Zod validation at startup** - the process crashes immediately if a required variable is missing or malformed, rather than failing mysteriously at runtime.
- **Type safety** - `env.DATABASE_URL` is typed as `string`, not `string | undefined`. No more `process.env.DATABASE_URL!` casts.
- **Composability** - packages export their `env` object, and apps extend them. For example, the API server's `env.ts` extends the database, storage, logger, and billing envs, inheriting all their variables.

You should **never read `process.env` directly** in application code. Always import from the nearest `env.ts`:

```ts
// Good
import { env } from "./env";
const port = env.API_PORT;

// Bad - bypasses validation
const port = process.env.API_PORT;
```

The `emptyStringAsUndefined: true` option is enabled everywhere, so setting a variable to an empty string is treated the same as not setting it at all.

For boolean variables, the codebase uses `z.stringbool()` which accepts `"true"`, `"false"`, `"1"`, `"0"`, `"yes"`, and `"no"`.

## Core API Server

**Source:** `apps/api/src/env.ts`

The API server extends the database, storage, logger, and billing environments, so all variables from those sections apply here too.

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `API_PORT` | Yes | - | Port the API server listens on. Typically `4000`. |
| `INTERNAL_DOMAIN` | No | `autonoma.app` | Internal domain used for routing and service discovery. |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | No | `http://localhost:3000` | Comma-separated list of CORS origins. Must include the frontend URL. |
| `SCENARIO_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Yes | - | Key used to encrypt scenario data. Any non-empty string works for local dev. |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Yes | - | OAuth 2.0 client ID from Google Cloud Console. Required for user authentication. |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Yes | - | OAuth 2.0 client secret from Google Cloud Console. |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` | No | - | Client ID of a GitHub OAuth app, enabling GitHub sign-in. Callback URL: `<BETTER_AUTH_URL>/v1/auth/callback/github`. Not the same as `GITHUB_APP_*`. |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | No | - | Client secret of that GitHub OAuth app. GitHub sign-in is offered only when both this and `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` are set. |
| `AGENT_VERSION` | No | `latest` | Version tag for the execution agent. Used when dispatching engine jobs. |
| `POSTHOG_KEY` | No | - | PostHog project API key for server-side analytics. Omit to disable analytics. |
| `POSTHOG_HOST` | No | `https://us.i.posthog.com` | PostHog ingestion endpoint. Override for self-hosted PostHog instances. |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | With proxy + Stripe | - | Server-side OpenRouter key used by the billed planner proxy mode. The proxy returns `503` if the selected upstream is incomplete. |
| `LLM_PROXY_ENABLED` | No | `false` | Explicitly mounts the planner LLM proxy. With Stripe enabled it uses metered OpenRouter; with Stripe disabled it requires the complete OpenAI-compatible configuration below. |
| `LLM_PROXY_ALLOWED_MODELS` | No | `google/gemini-3-flash-preview` | Comma-separated allowlist of Planner-facing model ids. In private compatible mode accepted requests are rewritten to `AI_COMPATIBLE_MODEL`. Empty falls back to the default. |
| `REDIS_URL` | Yes | - | Redis connection string (e.g., `redis://localhost:6379`). Used for device locking, caching, and pub/sub. |
| `TESTING` | No | `false` | Set to `true` in test environments. Prevents importing certain modules. Not for general use. |
| `ENGINE_BILLING_SECRET` | No | - | Shared secret for authenticating billing calls from the engine. |

---

## Frontend (UI)

**Source:** `apps/ui/src/env.ts`

The frontend uses Vite's `import.meta.env` and requires the `VITE_` prefix for all variables.

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `VITE_API_URL` | No | `http://localhost:4000` | URL of the API server. The frontend makes all tRPC calls to this address. |
| `VITE_INTERNAL_DOMAIN` | No | `autonoma.app` | Internal domain, used for UI routing logic. |
| `VITE_TEMPORAL_URL` | No | - | URL of the Temporal UI. When set, enables links to workflow runs in the dashboard. |
| `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` | No | - | Sentry DSN for frontend error tracking. Omit to disable Sentry in the browser. |
| `VITE_SENTRY_URL` | No | - | Sentry organization URL. Used for linking to Sentry issues from the UI. |
| `VITE_POSTHOG_KEY` | No | - | PostHog project API key for frontend analytics. Omit to disable analytics. PostHog events are proxied through the API server at `/rs` (feature flags at `/flags`) to bypass ad blockers. |

---

## Database

**Source:** `packages/db/src/env.ts`

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | - | PostgreSQL connection string. Format: `postgresql://user:password@host:port/database`. Used by Prisma for all database operations. |

:::note
For local development, a typical value is `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/autonoma`. Make sure PostgreSQL is running and the database exists before starting the API.
:::

---

## AI Services

**Source:** `packages/ai/src/env.ts`

The web and mobile execution engines support the built-in provider set or one OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoint. The API server also reads this configuration when `LLM_PROXY_ENABLED=true` and `STRIPE_ENABLED=false`, allowing the Planner to reuse the private compatible gateway.

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AI_PROVIDER` | No | `builtin` | `builtin` uses Gemini, Groq, and OpenRouter. `openai-compatible` routes every web/mobile execution model slot through the custom endpoint below. |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | When `AI_PROVIDER=builtin` | - | Google Gemini API key. Used for the primary visual models. |
| `GROQ_KEY` | When `AI_PROVIDER=builtin` | - | Groq API key. Used for fast text inference. |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | When `AI_PROVIDER=builtin` | - | OpenRouter API key. Used for fast visual inference and pointer grounding. |
| `AI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URL` | When `AI_PROVIDER=openai-compatible` | - | OpenAI-compatible API base URL, including its API prefix, for example `https://llm.example.com/v1`. |
| `AI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY` | When `AI_PROVIDER=openai-compatible` | - | Bearer token sent to the compatible endpoint. |
| `AI_COMPATIBLE_MODEL` | When `AI_PROVIDER=openai-compatible` | - | Default model ID for all execution capabilities. |
| `AI_COMPATIBLE_FAST_VISUAL_MODEL` | No | `AI_COMPATIBLE_MODEL` | Optional model override for lightweight screenshot analysis. |
| `AI_COMPATIBLE_SMART_VISUAL_MODEL` | No | `AI_COMPATIBLE_MODEL` | Optional model override for agent reasoning and visual assertions. |
| `AI_COMPATIBLE_FAST_TEXT_MODEL` | No | `AI_COMPATIBLE_MODEL` | Optional model override for fast text-only work. |
| `AI_COMPATIBLE_POINTER_MODEL` | No | `AI_COMPATIBLE_MODEL` | Optional web-only model override for visual element grounding. |

Example custom configuration:

```dotenv
AI_PROVIDER=openai-compatible
AI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URL=https://llm.example.com/v1
AI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY=your-compatible-api-key
AI_COMPATIBLE_MODEL=qwen2.5-vl-72b-instruct
```

The selected endpoint must implement OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions`. For full test execution, its models must accept image inputs, structured JSON output, and tool calls. Use the per-capability overrides when one model does not provide all three capabilities. Custom endpoint usage retains token telemetry, but its monetary cost is recorded as zero because Autonoma cannot infer private-provider pricing.

This switch covers web/mobile test generation and execution. For a self-hosted Planner proxy, inject `AI_PROVIDER`, `AI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URL`, `AI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY`, and `AI_COMPATIBLE_MODEL` into the API container too. The diffs worker has separate analysis and video model settings documented by that worker.

:::note
Validation is skipped when running in Vitest (`VITEST` env var is set), so you do not need these keys to run unit tests.
:::

---

## Storage (S3-compatible)

**Source:** `packages/storage/src/env.ts`

Used for storing screenshots, video recordings, test artifacts, and other binary assets.

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `S3_BUCKET` | Yes | - | Bucket name for storing artifacts. |
| `S3_REGION` | Yes | - | Region of the bucket (e.g., `us-east-1` or `cn-hangzhou`). |
| `S3_ENDPOINT` | No | AWS SDK default | S3-compatible endpoint. Set this to the OSS S3-compatible endpoint when using Alibaba Cloud OSS. |
| `S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE` | No | `false` | Keep `false` for AWS S3 and Alibaba Cloud OSS. Set `true` for local providers that require path-style URLs. |
| `S3_RESPONSE_CONTENT_TYPE_OVERRIDE` | No | `true` | Set `false` for OSS because its S3-compatible presigned GET endpoint rejects response Content-Type overrides. |
| `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | No | AWS SDK credential chain | Static access key ID. For OSS, use a restricted RAM AccessKey ID. |
| `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | No | AWS SDK credential chain | Static secret access key. For OSS, use the matching RAM AccessKey Secret. |

:::tip[Alibaba Cloud OSS]
OSS exposes an S3-compatible API, so no separate OSS SDK is required. For a bucket in Hangzhou, use `S3_REGION=cn-hangzhou`, `S3_ENDPOINT=https://oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com`, `S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=false`, and `S3_RESPONSE_CONTENT_TYPE_OVERRIDE=false`. If the application runs in the same Alibaba Cloud region, prefer the internal endpoint such as `https://oss-cn-hangzhou-internal.aliyuncs.com`. The endpoint and region must match the bucket. With response overrides disabled, uploaded objects retain and serve their stored Content-Type metadata.

The `S3_` variable names describe the protocol used by Autonoma. The credentials are Alibaba Cloud RAM credentials when OSS is the backend. Stored object locators remain in `s3://bucket/key` form for application compatibility.
:::

:::tip[Local development with MinIO]
You can run [MinIO](https://min.io/) locally as an S3-compatible object store. The default credentials are `minioadmin`/`minioadmin`. Set `S3_ENDPOINT` to the MinIO API endpoint (commonly `http://localhost:9000`), set `S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=true`, use any valid region string (e.g., `us-east-1`), and create a bucket matching your `S3_BUCKET` value.
:::

## Logging and Observability

**Source:** `packages/logger/src/env.ts`

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `NODE_ENV` | No | `development` | Node environment. Accepts `development`, `production`, or `test`. Affects log formatting and behavior. |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | No | - | Sentry DSN for backend error tracking and performance monitoring. Omit to disable Sentry. |
| `SENTRY_ENV` | No | `production` | Sentry environment tag (e.g., `staging`, `production`). |
| `SENTRY_RELEASE` | No | `unknown` | Sentry release identifier. Typically set to the git SHA or version tag in CI. |
| `DEBUG` | No | - | Debug filter string. When set, enables verbose debug logging for matching namespaces (e.g., `autonoma:*`). |

---

## Billing (Stripe)

**Source:** `packages/billing/src/env.ts`

Billing is entirely optional. When `STRIPE_ENABLED` is `false` (the default), all billing features are disabled and no other Stripe variables are needed.

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `STRIPE_ENABLED` | No | `false` | Master switch for billing. Set to `true` to enable Stripe integration. |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | No | - | Stripe secret API key. Required when `STRIPE_ENABLED` is `true`. |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | No | - | Stripe webhook signing secret for verifying incoming webhook events. Required when `STRIPE_ENABLED` is `true`. |
| `BILLING_GRACE_PERIOD_DAYS` | No | `3` | Number of days after a subscription lapses before access is revoked. |
| `APP_URL` | No | `http://localhost:3000` | Frontend application URL. Used in Stripe checkout redirect URLs and billing emails. |

---

## Kubernetes and Workflows

**Source:** `packages/k8s/src/env.ts` and `packages/workflow/src/env.ts`

These variables are only needed in production or when running engine jobs on Kubernetes. Not required for local development.

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `NAMESPACE` | Yes (in K8s) | `local` (API) | Kubernetes namespace this environment runs in - `production`, `beta`, or a per-PR alpha namespace. Used by `@autonoma/k8s` to deploy jobs, and by the API to namespace session keys. See the warning below. |

:::danger[`NAMESPACE` is a session boundary, not just a deploy target]
Every environment shares one Redis, and sessions live **only** there - `storeSessionInDatabase` is off. The API prefixes its session keys with `better-auth:<NAMESPACE>:` (`apps/api/src/auth.ts`), so two environments sharing a value share one session store: a session minted by an alpha, running unreviewed PR code, would be a valid production session. Changing the value invalidates every session in the environment that adopts it.
:::

The workflow package also reads:

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | - | PostgreSQL connection string. The workflow package needs direct DB access for job coordination. |
| `SENTRY_ENV` | No | - | Sentry environment tag for workflow jobs. |

---

## Engine - Web (Playwright)

**Source:** `packages/engine-web/src/platform/env.ts` and `packages/engine-web/src/execution-agent/env.ts`

The web engine extends the AI, database, logger, and storage environments. All variables from those sections apply.

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `REMOTE_BROWSER_URL` | No | - | WebSocket URL of a remote browser instance (e.g., Browserless or Playwright remote). When omitted, launches a local Chromium browser. |
| `HEADLESS` | No | - | Set to any value to run Playwright in headless mode. When omitted, the browser window is visible (useful for local debugging). |

---

## Engine - Mobile (Appium)

**Source:** `packages/engine-mobile/src/platform/env.ts`

The mobile engine extends the AI, database, logger, and storage environments. All variables from those sections apply.

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `APPIUM_HOST` | No | - | Hostname of the Appium server. |
| `APPIUM_PORT` | No | - | Port of the Appium server. |
| `APPIUM_MJPEG_PORT` | No | - | Port for the Appium MJPEG video stream. Used for live frame capture during test execution. |
| `APPIUM_SYSTEM_PORT` | No | - | System port used by Appium's UiAutomator2 (Android) or WebDriverAgent (iOS). |
| `APPIUM_SKIP_INSTALLATION` | No | `true` | When `true`, skips reinstalling the app before each test. Speeds up repeated runs on the same device. |
| `DEVICE_NAME` | No | - | Name of the target device or emulator (e.g., `iPhone 15 Pro`, `Pixel 7`). |
| `IOS_PLATFORM_VERSION` | No | - | iOS version to target (e.g., `17.2`). Required for iOS testing. |
| `ANDROID_DAEMON_HOSTS` | No | - | Comma-separated list of Android daemon host addresses for distributed device access. |
| `IOS_DAEMON_HOSTS` | No | - | Comma-separated list of iOS daemon host addresses for distributed device access. |
| `SKIP_DEVICE_DATE_UPDATE` | No | `false` | When `true`, skips updating the device date/time before tests. Useful when the device clock is already correct. |

---

## Jobs

### Execution Agent Runner

**Source:** `packages/engine/src/execution-agent/runner/env.ts`

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ARTIFACT_DIR` | No | - | Local directory for saving test artifacts (screenshots, videos, step logs). Used by the local runner during development. |

### Run Completion Notification

**Source:** `apps/jobs/run-completion-notification/src/env.ts`

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | - | PostgreSQL connection string. |
| `API_URL` | No | - | API server URL for callbacks. |
| `ENGINE_BILLING_SECRET` | No | - | Shared secret for authenticating billing-related calls. |
| `STRIPE_ENABLED` | No | `false` | Whether to process billing events on run completion. |

### Worker - Diffs

**Source:** `apps/workers/diffs/src/env.ts`

Diffs analysis and resolution run as Temporal activities in the `@autonoma/worker-diffs` worker. AI model keys come from the AI Services section; this worker adds the GitHub App credentials it needs to clone repositories and read PRs.

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GITHUB_APP_ID` | Yes | - | GitHub App ID for repository access. |
| `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` | Yes | - | GitHub App private key, base64-encoded PEM (`cat key.pem \| base64`). |
| `GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Yes | - | GitHub App webhook secret for verifying events. |
| `GITHUB_APP_SLUG` | Yes | - | GitHub App slug (URL-friendly name). |
| `SENTRY_DSN_WORKER_DIFFS` | No | - | Sentry DSN for the diffs worker. |

---

## GitHub App

These variables appear in `.env.example` and are used by the API server and the diffs worker for GitHub integration features (repository connections, PR-triggered test runs).

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GITHUB_APP_ID` | No | - | GitHub App ID. Required for GitHub integration features. |
| `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` | No | - | GitHub App private key, base64-encoded PEM (`cat key.pem \| base64`). Decoded at boot. |
| `GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | No | - | Secret for verifying GitHub webhook payloads. |
| `GITHUB_APP_SLUG` | No | - | GitHub App slug (URL-friendly name). Used for generating installation links. |

---

## Authentication

These variables are referenced in `.env.example` for the Better Auth integration used by the API server.

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | Yes | - | Secret key for Better Auth session signing. Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`. |
| `BETTER_AUTH_URL` | Yes | - | Root origin of the API server (e.g., `http://localhost:4000`). Used by Better Auth for callback URLs. Origin only - see the warning below. |
| `OAUTH_PROXY_PRODUCTION_URL` | No | - | The one origin whose OAuth callback is registered with the providers, for the whole fleet. Every deployed environment sets the same value. Leave unset locally. |
| `OAUTH_PROXY_SECRET` | No | `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | Encrypts the profile payload the proxy hands back to the originating environment. Every participating environment must share the same value. |

:::caution[`BETTER_AUTH_URL` takes an origin, not a path]
Better Auth is mounted with basePath `/v1/auth` and appends that itself. A value like `https://yourdomain.com/v1` makes every auth endpoint 404.
:::

### OAuth proxying

A provider only redirects to callback URLs registered with it ahead of time, and an alpha environment's hostname is minted per PR - so it can never be one of them. Instead, every deployed environment sends the provider **production's** callback URL and gets the resulting profile handed back, encrypted and short-lived, at its own origin, where it mints its own session. Production's own `APP_URL` matches `OAUTH_PROXY_PRODUCTION_URL`, so it skips proxying and serves the callback for the fleet.

Two things about this are easy to get wrong:

- **Leave both unset locally.** Local dev has its own OAuth apps, and enabling the proxy would mean configuring production to hand encrypted session payloads to a developer's machine.
- **`OAUTH_PROXY_PRODUCTION_URL` is not a plain on/off switch.** Setting it without every participating environment sharing the same `OAUTH_PROXY_SECRET` breaks sign-in on the non-production environments.

`OAUTH_PROXY_SECRET` is deliberately separate from `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`: it is shared across environments, so a leak must not also be able to forge sessions. It falls back to `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` when unset, which works but widens the blast radius.

## Tips for Local Development

**What you can skip entirely:**

- **Billing** - Leave `STRIPE_ENABLED=false` (the default). No Stripe keys needed.
- **Analytics** - Omit `POSTHOG_KEY` and `VITE_POSTHOG_KEY`. Analytics calls become no-ops.
- **Sentry** - Omit `SENTRY_DSN` and `VITE_SENTRY_DSN`. Error tracking is disabled gracefully.
- **Kubernetes** - Omit `NAMESPACE`. The API defaults it to `local`; only `@autonoma/k8s` needs a real one.
- **OAuth proxying** - Omit `OAUTH_PROXY_PRODUCTION_URL` and `OAUTH_PROXY_SECRET`. Local dev signs in against its own OAuth apps.
- **GitHub App** - Omit all `GITHUB_APP_*` variables unless you are working on GitHub integration.
- **Temporal** - Omit `VITE_TEMPORAL_URL`. The UI hides workflow links when this is unset.

**What uses defaults that just work:**

- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` defaults to `http://localhost:3000` - correct for local dev.
- `VITE_API_URL` defaults to `http://localhost:4000` - correct for local dev.
- `APP_URL` defaults to `http://localhost:3000` - correct for local dev.
- `NODE_ENV` defaults to `development`.
- `AGENT_VERSION` defaults to `latest`.

**What you must provide:**

- `DATABASE_URL` - there is no default. You need a running PostgreSQL instance.
- `REDIS_URL` - there is no default. You need a running Redis instance.
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` - required for authentication. Create OAuth credentials in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` - optional. Set both to add GitHub as a second sign-in option; see [Development Setup](/development/setup/) for the OAuth app steps.
- `SCENARIO_ENCRYPTION_KEY` - any non-empty string works locally.
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` - generate one with `openssl rand -hex 32`.
- `BETTER_AUTH_URL` - set to `http://localhost:4000`. The origin only; appending `/v1` 404s every auth endpoint.
- AI keys (`GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) - required if you are running test execution. Not needed if you are only working on the UI or API without triggering test runs.
- S3-compatible storage - a bucket and region are required for artifact storage. Use MinIO locally or configure AWS S3/Alibaba Cloud OSS credentials.
