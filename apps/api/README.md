# @autonoma/api

Backend API server for the Autonoma platform. Exposes a tRPC API over HTTP with social sign-in (Google, GitHub and Microsoft), optional enterprise CAS sign-in, GitHub webhook handling, and organization-based multi-tenancy.

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime:** Node 22 (ESM-only)
- **HTTP Framework:** Hono
- **API Layer:** tRPC with SuperJSON transformer
- **Auth:** better-auth (Google, GitHub + Microsoft OAuth, session-based, Redis-backed with a Postgres copy)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL via Prisma (`@autonoma/db`)
- **Storage:** S3-compatible object storage via `@autonoma/storage` (AWS S3, Alibaba Cloud OSS, MinIO, or MiniStack)
- **Observability:** Sentry (logging, error tracking, tracing)
- **Analytics:** PostHog via `@autonoma/analytics`
- **Build:** tsup (bundled ESM, targets Node 22)

## Running

```bash
# From the monorepo root
pnpm dev           # starts API (port 4000) and UI (port 3000) concurrently

# From this directory
pnpm dev           # starts API with --env-file=../../.env and tsx watch
pnpm build         # production build via tsup
pnpm typecheck     # tsc --noEmit
pnpm lint          # biome check with auto-fix
pnpm test          # unit tests (vitest)
pnpm test:integration  # integration tests (vitest, Testcontainers)
```

## Enterprise CAS

Enterprise CAS is optional and isolated under `src/enterprise-auth/cas/`. It delegates one-time ticket validation to `tianshu-manager-service`, then creates an independent Better Auth user, account link, session, and organization membership. Manager browser tokens are never accepted or shared.

Set all three variables to enable it; a partial configuration fails at startup:

```dotenv
CAS_MANAGER_BASE_URL=https://tianshu-test.ruijie.com.cn/tianshu-manager-service
CAS_LOGIN_URL=https://sid.ruijie.com.cn/login
CAS_IDENTITY_EXCHANGE_SECRET=<shared-server-secret>
```

The test manager web app is served from `https://tianshu-test.ruijie.com.cn` and routes its relative `/tianshu-manager-service` API prefix to the backend. Autonoma therefore calls the identity exchange endpoint at `https://tianshu-test.ruijie.com.cn/tianshu-manager-service/v1/auth/exchange-cas-ticket`. `CAS_MANAGER_BASE_URL` may include a different gateway path prefix in other environments.

The identity exchange route is part of the accompanying `tianshu-manager-service` change. Deploy that service change to the test environment before enabling CAS in Autonoma; the existing deployment returns `No static resource v1/auth/exchange-cas-ticket` until the new controller route is present.

`CAS_IDENTITY_EXCHANGE_SECRET` must match the server-side value in `tianshu-manager-service` and must never use a `VITE_*` variable. The manager-web origin is not the CAS `service` callback: CAS redirects the browser to the Autonoma callback shown below.

For local hosts-based testing, map `autonoma-test.ruijie.com.cn` to the Autonoma host and use the Vite origin for UI, API proxying, and the CAS callback:

```dotenv
APP_URL=http://autonoma-test.ruijie.com.cn:3000
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://autonoma-test.ruijie.com.cn:3000
VITE_API_URL=http://autonoma-test.ruijie.com.cn:3000
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://autonoma-test.ruijie.com.cn:3000
```

Allowlist this exact callback base URL in the manager service and CAS environment:

```text
http://autonoma-test.ruijie.com.cn:3000/v1/enterprise-auth/cas/callback
```

For deployment behind an HTTPS reverse proxy, remove `:3000` and use `https://autonoma-test.ruijie.com.cn` for all four public-origin values.

## Application memories

An application's memories are owner-authored notes every pipeline agent can read through progressive disclosure: the prompt carries an index of the memories (rendered by `renderApplicationMemoryIndex` in `@autonoma/types`), and a `read_memory` tool returns one memory's content on demand. Nothing in the pipeline writes them; a human does, from a local directory with one markdown file per memory:

```bash
pnpm --filter @autonoma/api memories:upsert -- --application-id <id> --dir ./memories
```

`DATABASE_URL` decides which environment is written. The run is idempotent: a memory the application does not have is created, one it has is rewritten in place, and memories the directory does not contain are left alone. Each `.md` file directly inside the directory is one memory, in the same shape as an E2E test file - YAML frontmatter, then the body:

```markdown
---
title: Checkout toast is transient
description: Read when a success toast disappeared before you could verify it.
---
The checkout success toast auto-dismisses after about three seconds. Seeing it vanish
before an assertion is expected behavior, not a bug.
```

- **The file name is the slug** (`checkout-toast-is-transient.md`), the identity the row is upserted by and the handle agents address it by. It must already be slug-shaped (lowercase words joined by dashes); the script tells you what to rename a file to otherwise. Renaming a file makes a new memory and leaves the old row behind, while editing `title` does not.
- `description` is what an agent sees before deciding to read the memory, so write it as *when to read this*. Any other frontmatter key is rejected, so a typo cannot silently drop a field.
- Whether a memory is visible to the pipeline is the `enabled` column, which the script never writes: rows are created enabled, and a re-run does not flip a row that was switched off in SQL. To run an application with its memories off (the control arm of an experiment), flip the column in SQL.

## Environment Variables

Defined in `src/env.ts` using `@t3-oss/env-core` with Zod validation. Also extends env schemas from `@autonoma/db`, `@autonoma/logger`, and `@autonoma/storage`.

Additionally, the inherited env schemas require database (`DATABASE_URL`), logger (`SENTRY_DSN`, `NODE_ENV`), and storage (`S3_BUCKET`, `S3_REGION`) variables. Storage may use the AWS SDK credential chain or static credentials; S3-compatible backends such as Alibaba Cloud OSS also set `S3_ENDPOINT` and the required addressing mode.

```

### MCP surface (`/v1/mcp`)

One server carries every Autonoma tool: onboarding an application (pinned by a pairing code, keyed by
`applicationId`) and debugging a reviewed pull request. Every tool outside the onboarding group takes
either identity - `resolve-mcp-target.ts` narrows the two optional fields to one target, and
`resolve-debug-target.ts` carries that further to the previewkit keys (`repoFullName` and the numeric
repository id) the debug tools reach their services by, via `github/application-repo.ts`. `/v1/mcp/debug` and `/v1/mcp/onboarding` are permanent aliases
serving the same tools - what differs is the guidance a client reads on connect and the `server`
property on the `mcp.tool_called` analytics event, so usage per address stays distinguishable.

`build-mcp-server.ts` composes the surface from registration functions onto one `McpServer`, so
"every address serves the same tools" is a property of that file rather than an agreement between
builders. Those functions are groupings, not surfaces: `registerDebugTools` and
`registerOnboardingTools` hold the tools only one job uses, and `registerReadTools` /
`registerApplyConfigTool` / `registerRecipeTools` / `registerInstructionsTools` hold the ones both
jobs reach for.

`registerInstructionsTools` is the one write that is not about configuration: `get_app_instructions`
and `update_app_instructions` read and edit `Application.customInstructions` and
`testScopeGuidelines` - the two free-text fields a user maintains on the settings page, which reach
the execution agent and the plan-authoring agent respectively. They exist so that what an agent
establishes in one session (a flagged issue that was a false positive, a screen that misleads the
agent) survives it, instead of being rediscovered next week. A write is a full replacement of a
human's prose with no version history behind it, so it is a compare-and-set: `get_app_instructions`
returns a `fingerprint`, and a write quoting a stale one comes back as a `conflict` result carrying
the current text to merge against, rather than overwriting it.

Writes run through `createWriteGuard`, which decides per call whether the write serializes with a
human. That decision is about the application, not the address: while an agent is driving an
application's onboarding, a user is watching a read-only config screen, so the write takes the
`OnboardingAgentSessionService` soft mutex and appears on that screen's activity feed (and stands
down when the user takes over). On an application nobody is configuring, the same tool just runs.
`isAgentDrivenApplication` (`routes/onboarding/agent-session-liveness.ts`) holds the rule.

### Planner LLM proxy (`/v1/llm-proxy`)

The planner CLI (`@autonoma-ai/planner`) sends model requests through one authenticated API route. It points its OpenRouter AI-SDK provider at
`${AUTONOMA_API_URL}/v1/llm-proxy` and authenticates with its Autonoma API token (same
`requireApiKey` path as `/v1/setup`).

The route is gated on `LLM_PROXY_ENABLED` (default `false`) so it is never an accidental
gateway - it is only mounted where explicitly enabled. Its upstream is selected once at startup:

- With `STRIPE_ENABLED=true`, it requires `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, forwards to OpenRouter, and meters organization credits.
- With `STRIPE_ENABLED=false`, it requires `AI_PROVIDER=openai-compatible` plus `AI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URL`, `AI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY`, and `AI_COMPATIBLE_MODEL`. It forwards to that private gateway without applying Autonoma billing.
- If the selected mode is incomplete, authenticated requests fail closed with `503 llm_proxy_unconfigured`.

The proxy:

1. Bounds the raw request body to `LLM_PROXY_MAX_REQUEST_BYTES` (`413 request_too_large` otherwise).
2. Enforces a Planner-facing model allowlist (`LLM_PROXY_ALLOWED_MODELS`, default = the single model the planner uses, `google/gemini-3-flash-preview`). Private compatible mode then rewrites the accepted model to `AI_COMPATIBLE_MODEL`.
3. In billed OpenRouter mode, runs the credit gate (`checkLlmProxyGate`, all refusals are `402` so the CLI surfaces a billing hint):
    - `out_of_credits` - the wallet is empty.
    - `grace_period_expired` - subscription payment overdue.
    - `free_cli_limit_reached` - a never-paid org has spent its free CLI allowance (`LLM_PROXY_FREE_CREDIT_CAP`, default 20k of the 100k free-start grant). Credits the org has paid for (top-up purchases + subscription grants, net of refunds) raise the budget one-for-one, so a paying/formerly-paying org is never blocked at the free cap; an active subscription lifts the cap outright. This is the primary abuse bound: a farmed free account can drain at most the cap through the CLI, regardless of concurrency.
4. Clamps `max_tokens` to `LLM_PROXY_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` (and sets it when omitted) so a single request stays cheap - keeping any overspend past the cap under concurrency negligible.
5. Forwards `chat/completions` to the selected upstream, streaming the response back unchanged.
6. In billed OpenRouter mode, meters the dollar cost OpenRouter reports into credits at the top-up rate and
   deducts from `BillingCustomer.creditBalance`, recording a `LLM_PROXY_CONSUMPTION` transaction
   (idempotent on the OpenRouter generation id). Surfaced in the billing UI as "AI CLI usage".

Private compatible mode does not call the billing gate or create billing transactions.

**Known limitation (concurrency):** the balance gate and the deduction are separate reads, so an
org near zero balance that fires N concurrent requests can have all N served (each costing real
OpenRouter tokens) while the balance only floors at zero. Per-call cost is tiny and the gate still
blocks once the wallet is empty, so the overspend is bounded; tighten with per-API-key rate limiting
(the `ApiKey` model already carries `rateLimit*` fields) or an atomic check-and-reserve if CLI volume
grows.

### Merge gate (the blocking `Autonoma` check)

Per-org opt-in blocking GitHub check on client bugs, skippable with a `/autonoma-skip <reason>` PR comment. Off by
default and bounded by the global `MERGE_GATE_ENABLED` kill switch; enabled per trusted org via the internal
`admin.setMergeGateEnabled` procedure.

- `MergeGateService` (`src/github/merge-gate.service.ts`) owns the API-side lifecycle: post the pending `Autonoma`
  check on `pull_request.opened/synchronize/reopened/ready_for_review`; start requested analysis runs from the
  on-demand activation triggers (`/start analysis` comment, `pull_request.labeled`); honor a
  `/autonoma-skip <reason>` comment on
  an `issue_comment.created` webhook (resolve the PR's current check, write a `SkipRecord` snapshotting the open
  bugs + the reason, flip the check to `neutral`, post a `skipped`-state attribution comment, and fire a best-effort
  Slack alert via `MergeGateSlackNotifier` - the `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` bot posting to `MERGE_GATE_SLACK_CHANNEL`); a
  reason is mandatory, so a bare or whitespace-only `/autonoma-skip` does not skip - it replies asking for a reason
  and leaves the check failing; persist merge
  facts and detect a "merged around us" bypass on `pull_request.closed`; and, on enable/disable, create/remove a
  repo ruleset that requires the `Autonoma` check on ALL branches - so every PR is gated regardless of its base
  branch, not only the default branch. The check, verdict, and skip already apply to every PR on any branch; the
  ruleset is only what makes a `failure` actually block the merge.
- The verdict -> conclusion mapping runs in the **diffs worker** after authoritative analysis settlement, through
  `settleAnalysisRun` / `settleAnalysisGitHub`; the PR comment is also an effect of that terminal path. The shared
  check-run store and the pure verdict mapping live in
  `@autonoma/github/check`.
- Fail-open on a job error (conclusion `neutral`); fail-closed if Autonoma is fully unreachable (the required check
  never reaches success, so only a repo admin can override). See `merge-gate-implementation-spec.md`.
- **Activation** (`OrganizationSettings.activationEnabled`, off by default): an org migrated to activation never
  starts an automatic PR run on its own. `MergeGateService.requestAnalysisRun` is the single entrypoint every
  trigger calls - it flips the `Autonoma` check to in-progress FIRST, then fires the analysis run (the run
  preview-ready used to start automatically); doing the flip before the run, inside the same per-head lock the
  worker's finalize takes, keeps a late flip from clobbering the finalize's verdict. On a real start it records the
  activation (`activationSource` + `activatedByLogin` on `GitHubCheckRun`, an `ANALYSIS_RUN_SOURCE` value from
  `@autonoma/github/check`) and emits `merge_gate.activated`; if no run starts (no preview, or nothing new) the
  check is restored to the un-requested neutral state and the requester is told why. Only a migrated org honors an
  explicit request - an un-migrated org still runs automatically, so `/start analysis` there is a no-op. Requests
  come from three on-demand triggers, each flipping the check to in-progress and stamping a distinct
  `ANALYSIS_RUN_SOURCE`:
    - `comment` - a `/start analysis` PR comment (`requestStartFromCommentWebhook`), authorized to write-access
      commenters the same way skip is.
    - `mcp` - the `start_analysis` debug-MCP tool a coding agent calls from the editor.
    - `label` - the repo's configured `ApplicationTriggerConfig.analysisTriggerLabel` (default `autonoma:analyze`)
      being added to a PR (`requestStartFromLabelWebhook`). Labeling a DRAFT is a no-op that replies with guidance
      to mark the PR ready first (a draft has no preview to run against), rather than bouncing off `no_preview`.
      `postPending` auto-creates that label on the repo for activation orgs (before it takes the per-head check
      lock, since the label is repo-level and best-effort) so a developer can find and add it.
      Unlike `comment`, the `label` trigger does not run an explicit write-access check: GitHub already gates adding a
      PR label (triage+), so the action itself is the authorization.
      There is also one **automatic** trigger, `ApplicationTriggerConfig.autoRunOnReadyForReview` (off by default): when
      a repo opts in, an activation org auto-runs the analysis as soon as a non-draft PR's preview is live. Crucially it
      fires from the shared PR-diffs trigger (`autoRunsOnReady` lets the automatic preview-ready run through the
      activation gate), NOT from the `pull_request.ready_for_review` webhook - at webhook time the preview does not
      exist yet (it is built in response to that event), so triggering there would always find no preview. Because it
      rides the automatic run path rather than `requestAnalysisRun`, the diffs worker's **`openMergeGate`** step (the
      analysis pipeline's stage 0) flips the un-requested neutral check to the in-progress "Analyzing" state and stamps
      `activation_source = ready_for_review` at run start, mirroring the on-demand triggers; the worker's finalize then
      posts the verdict.
      Per-repo trigger config lives on `ApplicationTriggerConfig` (1:1 with `Application`); absence means the code
      defaults apply (see `readActivationTriggerConfig`). Because a migrated org's un-requested PR has no run,
      `postPending` posts a COMPLETED `neutral` "No analysis requested - comment `/start analysis` to run." check
      rather than a hanging `in_progress` one, so a required check never wedges the merge. The automatic PR run is
      suppressed in the shared PR-diffs trigger (both the preview-ready and Vercel paths funnel through it)
      via a `requested` flag; main-branch baseline runs pass `isMainBranchRun` and are never gated (the base snapshot
      must keep updating), and un-migrated orgs (the fleet default) keep the current automatic behavior and the
      `in_progress` check.
- **One run per commit (dedupe)**: `requestAnalysisRun` takes a per-head advisory lock, so triggers for the same
  head serialize. A second trigger whose head already has an in-flight run (in-progress check + activation stamp)
  no-ops in the trigger handler; for a genuinely concurrent pair the handler pre-check cannot intercept (both
  read "not in flight" before either takes the lock), the trigger attaches a `requested` run to the
  existing pending snapshot for that head instead of superseding it, so no duplicate snapshot/run is created. In
  that race the later trigger still overwrites the recorded `activationSource` and emits a second
  `merge_gate.activated`; this is accepted, as de-duplicating it would require changing the untouchable
  `requestAnalysisRun`.
- **Requires GitHub App settings** (non-code): the `checks: write` permission, the `issue_comment` webhook
  subscription (for `/autonoma-skip` and `/start analysis`), the `pull_request.labeled` webhook subscription (for
  the activation label trigger - GitHub does not deliver labeled events without it), the `repository` webhook
  subscription (for the rename backfill below - without it a rename silently strands rows), and
  `administration: write` for programmatic branch protection. Nothing functions until these are applied.
- **Repo rename backfill** (`RepoRenameService`, `src/github/repo-rename.service.ts`): `githubRepositoryId` is a
  repo's stable identity, but eight tables denormalize `repoFullName` instead - `GitHubPrComment`,
  `GitHubCheckRun`, `BranchContributor`, `SkipRecord`, `BugFixOutcome`, `FindingFalsePositiveCandidate`,
  `PreviewkitBuildCircuit` and `PreviewkitEnvironment` - several keyed on it uniquely. On `repository.renamed`
  this rewrites all of them from the old full name to the new one in a single transaction, so a collision leaves
  every table untouched rather than half-migrated. Rows are matched by full name alone, NOT scoped to the
  webhook's organization: a GitHub full name is globally unique and two orgs may track one repo, so a global
  rewrite makes the first delivery fix everything and later ones no-ops. Without this a rename orphans every one
  of those rows silently - the PR-comment store finds nothing under the old name and posts a SECOND comment on a
  PR that already has one, the preview build circuit forgets an app's failure streak, and contributor
  attribution and skip records restart from empty. `repo-rename-tables.test.ts` derives the model list from
  `schema.prisma` and fails when a new table gains a `repoFullName` without being added. Not yet handled:
  `repository.transferred`, which changes the owner half of the name the same way.

  The same handler also maintains the `GitHubRepository` row those eight tables are migrating onto (see
  below). That row is RENAMED in place, never replaced: once the foreign keys exist, swapping the row would
  orphan every reference and reintroduce this exact bug against a different column. It is resolved by
  `githubId` first (the one identifier a rename cannot change) and by the old name second, which is what makes
  a webhook redelivery a no-op instead of a second row.
- **Repository identity** (`GitHubRepository`, migration `20260901120000_github_repository`): one row per repo
  we have stored anything about, keyed on `fullName` because that is the only identifier the existing rows
  carry - seven of the eight tables above hold no numeric id at all. `githubId` is the stable identity and is
  nullable, backfilled from `PreviewkitEnvironment` (the only table holding both) and otherwise filled in by
  the first rename webhook or API read. Nothing reads this table yet; it exists so those eight `repo_full_name`
  columns can become foreign keys to it, at which point a rename is one update and `REPO_NAME_BACKFILLS`
  disappears.

  **Historical rename damage is measurable, once.** The seed keys on the name, so a repo renamed *before* that
  migration seeds as two rows - one per name it has worn. That is a readout of how much the un-invalidated
  rename bug already cost, and it is only readable until the duplicates get cleaned up:

  ```sql
  SELECT github_repository_id, count(DISTINCT repo_full_name) AS names
  FROM previewkit_environment
  WHERE github_repository_id IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY github_repository_id
  HAVING count(DISTINCT repo_full_name) > 1;
  ```
- **Per-developer attribution** (`BranchContributorService`, `src/github/branch-contributor.service.ts`):
  stickiness is an individual habit, so a branch's outcome must attribute to ALL its authors, not just the
  opener. On `pull_request.opened/synchronize/reopened/ready_for_review/closed` it resolves the PR's full
  contributor set - every commit author (login when GitHub linked the email to an account) plus every
  `Co-authored-by:` co-author (kept as name/email, unresolved) plus the opener - and upserts one
  `BranchContributor` row per person, keyed by `(repoFullName, prNumber, contributorKey)` and accumulating
  across pushes. It also exposes `resolveFixingPushAuthors`,
  which returns the commit authors (including `Co-authored-by:` co-authors) for a given push/commit SHA. The
  `merge_gate.skipped` and `merge_gate.bypassed` PostHog events already carry the
  actor login (`actorLogin` / `mergedByLogin`) so the funnel breaks down per developer. Pure co-author
  parsing and contributor resolution live in `@autonoma/github` (`resolveContributorsFromCommits`,
  `parseCoAuthoredByTrailers`).

- **Bug-fixed-before-merge** (`BugFixOutcomeService`, `src/github/bug-fix-outcome.service.ts`): the stickiness
  "did it help?" measurement. On `pull_request.closed` for a merged PR of a gate-enabled org (hooked in right
  after `MergeGateService.recordMergeFromWebhook`), it records - per client bug we flagged - whether it was fixed
  before merge. It reads persisted state only and never re-runs analysis: the Reporter already resolves the
  branch-scoped `AnalysisIssue`s each run, so at merge time an issue's `status` already says whether the bug still
  reproduces. Per branch bug issue (`kind: "bug"`; environment/scenario are ignored): `resolved` ->
  `fixed_before_merge`, `open` -> `merged_with_bug`. A skipped PR records `skipped` - the `SkipRecord` is matched by
  the merged head SHA (like the gate's bypass detection), so a skip on a head later superseded by a fixing push does
  not hide the fix. A PR the analysis never authoritatively assessed (no completed `AnalysisReport` on the branch's
  latest non-twin run at or before the merge) records a single branch-level `unknown` marker; a clean PR records
  nothing. Outcomes persist to the FK-less tracking table `BugFixOutcome`, unique per `(branchId, issueId)`. It
  emits the `bug.fixed` and `bug.merged_open` PostHog events (`@autonoma/github/check` `BUG_FIX_OUTCOME_EVENT`) with
  an explicit distinctId and the org group; `skipped`/`unknown` emit no event, so a bypass is never double-counted
  against a per-bug signal. When a `BranchContributorService` is injected it attributes each fix to the authors of
  the resolving push (via `resolveFixingPushAuthors`, mapped from the issue's `resolvedAt`), riding their logins on
  `bug.fixed`.

### Analysis event inbox

A push persists an `AnalysisEvent` (the `@autonoma/analysis` inbox), and the analysis workflow drains it - it
peeks the newest pending event for a head and claims the branch's pending events when it opens the snapshot. Two
seams live in `src/analysis/`:

- `enqueueAndStartAnalysisRun` - enqueue then poke, for a real event we can act on now.
- `enqueueAnalysisEvent` - enqueue **without** poking, for a real event we cannot act on yet.

`analysisPokeGate` (`src/analysis/analysis-poke-gate.ts`) is the one poke-eligibility predicate - activation +
analysis credits - shared by every producer, so "wake the workflow" and "may the run proceed" cannot disagree. It
decides:

- **Not a real analyzable event** (app not live, base not trunk, draft, already-analyzed) -> nothing is inserted.
- **Real but deferred** -> the event persists without a poke. An activation-gated push waits for its explicit
  request to claim it; an out-of-credits push waits for the next natural trigger (a later push, or an explicit
  `/start analysis` / message request), which claims it when it opens its snapshot (the credits comment + refusal
  are unchanged, the event just also persists).
- **Otherwise** -> enqueue and poke.

A deferred event is **not** re-poked automatically on a credit top-up: forcing a burst of runs the moment a user
tops up is worse UX than letting the deferred work ride the next real trigger. The event is the durable record;
whatever run starts next claims it. (This is a deliberate reversal of the earlier top-up sweeper, removed with its
billing `onCreditsGranted` hook.)

Each producer threads its `source`
(`webhook`/`label`/`comment`/`ui`/`vercel`/`ci`/`onboarding`/`mcp`/`admin`/`http`/`chat`) down to the seam; the
merge-gate maps its activation `ANALYSIS_RUN_SOURCE` onto that enum. `chat` is a PR-review chat agent's forward,
recorded once the host confirms it.

### Agent-authored messages (`user_prompt` events)

An agent (a conversation agent in the app, a Claude Code plugin, the planner's smoke tests) can direct a PR's
analysis in natural language. `DeliverUserPromptService` (`src/analysis/deliver-user-prompt.service.ts`) is the one
seam - shaped like the future `AnalysisTrigger.deliver` adapter: it resolves and authorizes the branch, refuses a
message that could never be claimed (a closed/merged PR, an un-onboarded app - with nothing enqueued), pokes the
gate **requested-like** (bypasses activation, respects the credit floor), enqueues a `user_prompt` event, then
`signalWithStartAnalysisRun`s the run (start if idle, signal if mid-run - never terminate). It returns a
receipt (`started | deferred | refused`). Two thin transports share it, holding no decision logic:

- **HTTP** (`POST /v1/analysis/messages`, API key) - `{ repo_id, pr_number, message, author? }`.
- **MCP** - the `send_analysis_message` debug tool a coding agent calls from the editor.

v1 is directed re-analysis only: a message asking for suite EDITS is answered honestly as out of scope, not acted
on (the addressing lives in the diffs pipeline).

### Explicit deploy requests are not refusable

`PreviewkitTriggerService` has two kinds of entry point, and they answer to different authorities.

A trigger that came from GitHub (`startRunFromPullRequestWebhook`, `startMainBranchRunFromPushWebhook`)
opens an analysis run, and that run decides whether the commit warrants a preview at all - impact
analysis selecting no tests means no build.

A trigger that came from a person or an agent - the UI redeploy button, `apply_config` and
`trigger_deploy` over MCP, the `/v1/previewkit` HTTP routes, the admin actions - is a request for the
preview itself, not a verdict on the commit. Those paths (`startRunForRedeploy`,
`startRunForPullRequest`) launch the build directly with reason `force_build` and never consult
analysis, because an application whose test suite does not exist yet selects nothing and would be
refused every time - which is exactly the state an application is in while it is being set up.

A redeploy of an environment that does not exist yet first-deploys instead of reporting the
environment missing: the repository id is read from another environment the organization has for the
same repo, the head from GitHub, and environment 0 goes through `startMainBranchRun` (only the
Application knows which branch it deploys). The credits gate still applies to all of it.

One thing is refusable, and it is about concurrency rather than warrant. Deploys do not queue: the
launcher's per-environment mutex deletes the in-flight Job before creating the new one, so a second
request CANCELS the first (`apps/previewkit/CLAUDE.md`, "Concurrency model"). That makes an agent's
most predictable move - retrying a call it believes has not landed - the thing that throws away the
build it was waiting for, and a tool description saying so was not enough to stop it. So
`OnboardingManager.triggerPreviewkitMainDeploy` declines while a deploy is in flight, returning
`started: false, declined: "already_in_flight"` plus that deploy's live readiness instead of
superseding it. `force: true` supersedes deliberately; the tRPC route passes it always, because the
only way there is a person pressing Redeploy on a screen already showing them the deploy in flight.
"In flight" is `getPreviewReadiness`'s own `building` verdict and nothing separate, so a caller told
`failed` is never then refused the redeploy that failure is asking for. Nothing else changes: the
`/v1/previewkit` HTTP routes and the admin actions reach `startMainBranchRun` directly and supersede
as they always have.

`PREVIEWKIT_MAIN_BRANCH_BUILDS_ENABLED` (default `true`) is a fleet-wide kill switch on environment 0
specifically: while off, `startMainBranchRun` (onboarding's first deploy, and the missing-environment
recovery path above) throws `ConflictError`, and `startMainBranchRunFromPushWebhook` (every push to a
tracked main branch) logs and no-ops. It does not touch PR previews, and it does not touch a redeploy
of an environment 0 that already exists (`startRunForRedeploy` → `startExplicitBuild`), which stays
covered by "explicit deploy requests are not refusable" above.

### Previewkit deploy credits gate

A new preview deploy or per-app redeploy (never teardown) is declined once an org's combined
`BillingCustomer.creditBalance` is at or below zero - `PreviewkitTriggerService.deploy()` /
`.redeployApp()` call `checkPreviewDeployCreditsGate` before launching the Kubernetes Job. Gated by
two switches so enforcement rolls out per org without affecting anyone else:

- `PREVIEWKIT_BILLING_ENABLED` (default `false`) - the global master switch. Off means no org is
  ever blocked, no matter its own setting.
- `OrganizationSettings.previewkitBillingEnabled` (default `false`) - per-org opt-in, only
  consulted once the global switch is on.

A blocked deploy throws `InsufficientPreviewCreditsError` (`402` on the `/v1/previewkit` HTTP
routes) and posts a PR comment explaining why before throwing, so every trigger path - GitHub
webhook, HTTP route, or admin action - surfaces the same explanation regardless of how the deploy
was started. Usage still accrues and bills via the separate 15-minute usage-meter sweep
(`apps/cronjobs`) whether or not enforcement is on; this gate only controls whether a _new_ deploy
is allowed to start.

### PreviewKit config preflight

The onboarding PreviewKit config editor warns on app paths and Dockerfiles that do not exist in the
linked repo, backed by two collaborators in `src/github/`:

- `RepoReader` - shared read-only repo access (installation client, per `(repo, head SHA)` file-tree
  cache, and `package.json` / file-content readers).
- `RepoIntrospectionService` - the repo's file tree at its default-branch head, for the preflight
  checks and the config editor's Dockerfile picker.

Every GitHub failure degrades to `undefined`, so preflight warns less rather than blocking the
editor. Nothing here runs AI - the API server does no model inference of its own.

### Onboarding funnel analytics

Activation is instrumented end to end so a stalled customer is visible without asking them. `OnboardingAnalytics` (`src/routes/onboarding/onboarding-analytics.ts`) emits it; nothing is captured from inside a handler.

| Event                                   | Emitted from                                       | Answers                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `onboarding.step_changed`               | every path that moves the step - see below         | Which stages people actually reach (`fromStep`/`toStep`, `surface`, `action`)     |
| `onboarding.procedure_called`           | every onboarding tRPC mutation                     | What they retried and what it failed with (`success`, `durationMs`, `errorName`)  |
| `onboarding.deployment_signal_received` | the signal endpoint (`POST /v1/onboarding/signal`) | Whether the customer's CI ever posted, and what we did with it                    |
| `onboarding.dry_run_passed`             | `OnboardingSdkCapabilityService.runDryRun`, success path only | Who actually finished setting up, and when (`scenarioId`)              |
| `vercel.*`                              | `src/vercel-marketplace/vercel-analytics.ts`       | The Marketplace half: resource provisioning, plan changes, uninstalls, failed SSO |

`dry_run_passed` is the only one of these that means the customer's integration actually works: reaching `step = completed` is wizard clicks, and on the Vercel path `preview_verified` is reached by picking a deployment out of a dropdown. It is emitted beside the `dryRunPassedAt` stamp so the event cannot drift from the column, and **on the success path only** - a failed dry run returns `{ success: false }` rather than throwing, so the `onboarding.runScenarioDryRun` mutation event fires identically either way and cannot be used to count it. Emitting only on success is also what keeps the customer's endpoint error text - which has included a live credential - out of PostHog.

`step_changed` reaches the funnel two ways, and its `surface` property says which:

- **Inferred from a before/after read** (`surface: ui | agent`), by `onboardingWriteProcedure` around every onboarding mutation and by `guardedWrite` around every MCP tool write. Because the step is read either side of the call, a transition is caught wherever it was written - a state subclass, a capability service, a nested `writePreviewUrl` - rather than only where a handler remembered to say so.
- **Reported directly by the caller** (`surface: signal | system`), for the two paths no tracker wraps. `preview_verified` - the funnel's central conversion - is stamped by `writePreviewUrl`, which is also reached by the deployment-signal HTTP handler and by the `getPreviewReadiness` poll. Instrumenting only the wrappers would have counted that conversion for Vercel customers and nobody else. `writePreviewUrl` returns whether it advanced and from which step, so the "did it advance?" condition has exactly one definition, and both callers hand that straight to `stepAdvanced`.

Two further design points matter when extending this:

- **Mutations only.** Queries deliberately stay on `protectedProcedure` - the onboarding UI polls several of them continuously, and instrumenting reads would bury the funnel in poll traffic. A failing read is already captured browser-side. The readiness poll above is the one exception and costs a read only on the poll that actually flips the step.
- **Analytics never breaks a request.** Every emit path swallows its own failure into a warning.

`distinctId` is the acting user's id, matching `posthog.identify` in the browser, so these sit in one funnel with the client-side `onboarding.opened` and `onboarding.step_viewed` (both emitted from `apps/ui/src/routes/__root.tsx`). The two machine surfaces have no user - the customer's CI posts the signal, and the poll observes a deploy rather than an action - and are attributed to the organization instead. The client events count steps a user *saw*; the server events count steps the backend *persisted* - the gap between them for a given step is the drop-off.

### Organizations and memberships

`member` is a true join table (`@@unique([userId, organizationId])`), so **an account can belong to
several organizations**. Which one it is *acting as* is session state - `session.activeOrganizationId`,
held in Redis - not a property of the user. Two browsers can therefore be signed in as the same
account in two different organizations.

Three things put a membership on an account:

- **Auto-join by domain.** `ensureOrgMembership` (`src/auth.ts`) upserts an organization keyed on
  `organization.domain` at first sign-in. A bare domain (`acme.com`) means everyone with an
  `@acme.com` address lands in the same org; a full email address (`tom@gmail.com`) means the org is
  that one person's. `orgHasAutoJoinDomain` (`@autonoma/types`) is the single encoding of that
  distinction - do not re-derive it by string-matching a domain.
  **A bare-domain key is only minted when the identity provider vouches for the domain** - Google's
  `hd` claim, or a Microsoft tenant that proves the address (`resolveSignupOrganizationKey`). A
  provider that asserts nothing, GitHub included, always gets an address-keyed organization, even when
  another organization already holds that bare domain. Nothing is inferred from the domain string
  itself: guessing "company" pools strangers into one org as its owners, which an invitation cannot
  undo, whereas guessing "personal" costs colleagues one invitation.
- **Invitations** (`organization.invite` / `acceptInvitation`). Accepting **adds** a membership and
  points the session at it; nothing the user already belonged to is touched. Inviting an address that
  would auto-join by domain anyway is refused server-side, with an error saying so - but the Members
  page itself is shown for **every** organization. It was once hidden for auto-join orgs, which
  created a trap: someone invited into one could join it and then had no way to leave, because
  `Leave` lives on that page. Invitations go out as `RESEND_INVITES_FROM_EMAIL`, not the default
  `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` - the default also sends the onboarding email, which is deliberately from a
  person, and an invitation from someone's personal address reads as a mistake.
- **Vercel Marketplace installs and the admin org switcher**, which both upsert directly.

`organization.setActive` is what switches organizations, and it replaces better-auth's
`organization/set-active` (refused in the middleware) because the plugin cannot write
`user.lastOrganizationId` - without which every new session falls back to the oldest membership and a
multi-org user is dropped into the wrong place on each sign-in. The active organization stays *session*
state; `lastOrganizationId` only decides where a **new** session starts, so two browsers can differ.

`organization.rename` also stamps `organization.nameConfirmedAt`. An org created from a personal email
address is named after whoever signed up first - not necessarily whose org it is - so `needsNaming` on
`auth.activeOrg` asks once and that stamp is what stops it asking again.

`organization.leave` is the inverse, and refuses two cases via `resolveLeaveBlockedReason` - shared by
the read that renders the button and the write that performs the leave, so they cannot disagree:

- `last-organization`: an account with zero memberships can reach nothing, and `ensureOrgMembership`
  would mint a fresh empty org on their next sign-in rather than returning them anywhere useful.
- `last-member`: nothing could ever grant access to a memberless organization again, so its
  applications would be unreachable.

Two ordering rules exist because "which organization?" has more than one answer:

- **`ensureOrgMembership` starts a session in `user.lastOrganizationId`**, falling back to the
  oldest membership. The remembered choice is joined through `member`, so one naming an org the user
  has since left is ignored rather than trusted. The fallback is ordered because an unordered
  `findFirst` drifted between sign-ins for multi-org accounts - which is why the Vercel path needed
  `vercelPreferredOrgKey` in Redis to force a specific org.
- **`AuthService.getOrgStatus` reads the *active* org's status**, not "some org this user is in".
  Unordered, an account approved in one org and pending in another was sent to `/pending` or not
  depending on row order.

**A session lives in more than one place, so never write one by hand.** The `session` table is the
durable copy (`session.storeSessionInDatabase: true`), Redis is the cache `getSession` reads first,
and Redis also holds an `active-sessions-<userId>` index beside it. `setSessionActiveOrg` delegates to
better-auth's `internalAdapter.updateSession`, which updates all three - it runs the durable write via
`executeMainFn: options.session.storeSessionInDatabase`. Reaching for `secondaryStorage.set` instead
touches only the cache, and since the shared Redis runs `maxmemory 400mb` with `allkeys-lru`, an
evicted session leaves the user signed in (Postgres backs them) while every write silently finds no
key and does nothing. That is what made every `organization.setActive` a no-op on beta.

**Losing a membership has to end access, not just delete a row.** `protectedProcedure` authorizes on
`session.activeOrganizationId` and never re-checks `member`, so a session already acting as the lost
organization would keep full access until it expired - days. `evictSessionsFromOrg` therefore runs on
both `leave` and `removeMember`: sessions aimed at the lost org move to a remaining membership (or are
revoked outright when none is left), sessions working in an unrelated org are untouched, and any
`lastOrganizationId` pointing at it is cleared. Getting this right for `leave` but not `removeMember`
was a real hole - a removed user kept access.

**An API key is the one credential membership loss does not revoke.** `verifyApiKey` resolves a key to
`{ userId, organizationId }` and every key-authenticated surface (`/v1/setup`, previewkit, diffs, the
LLM proxy) then authorizes on the organization alone - so a key outlives its creator's membership by
design, because it is routinely the credential in the organization's own CI. `removeMember` therefore
takes an explicit `apiKeyIds` list and deletes only those, in the same transaction as the membership
(the remover picks from `apiKeys.listForMember`, shown with each key's `lastRequest`). `organizationId`
and `userId` in that `deleteMany`'s WHERE are the authorization - the ids are caller-supplied. Anything
left behind is surfaced by `apiKeys.list` as `ownerLeft`, which is what stops a credential held by
somebody outside the organization sitting on that screen indistinguishable from a colleague's.

**This API does not rate limit itself - the WAF on the CloudFront distribution does.** Better Auth's
built-in limiter is switched off explicitly (`rateLimit.enabled: false`), because it keys on the client
address in `X-Forwarded-For` and refuses to trust the multi-hop chain that arrives through CloudFront
and the ALB: it then falls back to a single bucket shared by the whole deployment and answers 429 to
every user at once, sign-in included. Leaving the option out is not the same as this - Better Auth
enables the limiter by default in production.

The `organization()` better-auth plugin's own membership endpoints (`invite-member`,
`accept-invitation`, `add-member`, `leave`, `set-active`, ...) are refused in the `hooks.before` middleware: they
bypass the invitation checks, the leave guards and the session re-pointing above. Its read endpoints
(`list`, `set-active`) stay open - the org switcher uses them.

### Environment Factory endpoint (`/api/autonoma`)

This app is its own customer: `src/autonoma-sdk/` implements the Autonoma SDK test-data endpoint that
Autonoma calls to seed a tenant into an alpha preview before running the dogfood E2E suite against
it. `factories.ts` holds one factory per model; `autonoma-sdk-http.router.ts` wires them into
`createHonoHandler` and owns auth (a real Better Auth session cookie for the seeded user) and the
org-cascade teardown.

The endpoint is inert unless `AUTONOMA_SHARED_SECRET` and `AUTONOMA_SIGNING_SECRET` are set, which
is only true on alphas.

The scenarios themselves live in Autonoma, not here - `discover` returns the *schema*
(`DiscoverResponse` is `{ schema }`), and the recipes are uploaded separately to
`POST /v1/setup/setups/:id/scenario-recipe-versions`. **Deleting a factory whose model a live recipe
still seeds breaks provisioning outright**: the handler rejects the entire `up` with
`no factory registered for model "X"`, and nothing in CI notices. Check the app's current recipe
before removing one.

Two constraints in `factories.ts` are load-bearing and easy to undo by accident:

- **Identifiers a recipe supplies are honored verbatim.** The router resolves `/app/:slug`,
  `/snapshots/:id` and `/onboarding?appId=` by exact match, so a factory-appended suffix makes every
  deep-link in a test unresolvable. Cross-run uniqueness is the recipe's job, via a
  `{testRunId}`-templated value on the globally-unique columns.
- **`PreviewkitEnvironment.githubRepositoryId` + `prNumber` are a lookup key**, not free-form data.
  `DeploymentsService.previewSummaryByPr` finds the branch by `prInfo.prNumber` then matches
  `{ organizationId, githubRepositoryId, prNumber }`; if any of the three disagree with the
  Application and the FeatureBranchInfo, the PR's Preview tab renders its empty state.
- **`Member` decides who exists besides the agent.** The auth callback upserts a membership for
  whoever signs in, so a recipe that seeds no `Member` rows produces an organization of exactly one
  person - and nothing needing a second (removing a member, a colleague's key, an organization
  somebody can leave) can be tested at all. The factory upserts for that reason: it races the auth
  callback on `(userId, organizationId)`. A key whose owner is deliberately given no `Member` row is
  how a recipe seeds the orphaned-key state.

### tRPC Routers

Each router is thin wiring - business logic lives in the corresponding service class. Routers are defined in `src/routes/` and composed in `src/routes/router.ts`.

| Router         | Service                     | Domain                      |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `admin`        | `AdminService`              | Admin operations            |
| `auth`         | `AuthService`               | User and session management |
| `applications` | `ApplicationsService`       | Test target applications    |
| `branches`     | `BranchesService`           | Test suite branches         |
| `folders`      | `FoldersService`            | Test organization           |
| `runs`         | `RunsService`               | Test execution runs         |
| `generations`  | `TestGenerationsService`    | AI test generation          |
| `tests`        | `TestsService`              | Test cases                  |
| `scenarios`    | `ScenariosService`          | Execution scenarios         |
| `github`       | `GitHubInstallationService` | GitHub app integrations     |
| `onboarding`   | `OnboardingService`         | User onboarding             |
| `organization` | `OrganizationService`       | Members and invitations     |
| `snapshotEdit` | `SnapshotEditService`       | Snapshot editing            |

### Procedure Types

Defined in `src/trpc.ts`:

- **`publicProcedure`** - No auth required. Has Sentry tracing and error mapping middleware.
- **`protectedProcedure`** - Requires authenticated user with an active organization.
- **`writeProcedure`** - `protectedProcedure` that also rejects writes from the read-only demo org. Every customer-facing mutation uses this.
- **`internalProcedure`** - Requires admin role. The staff-only catalog mutations (`folders.*`, `tests.rename`, `tests.delete`) use it in place of `writeProcedure`.

Plus one domain-scoped builder: **`onboardingWriteProcedure`** (`src/routes/onboarding/onboarding-write-procedure.ts`) - `writeProcedure` with funnel analytics attached. See [Onboarding funnel analytics](#onboarding-funnel-analytics).

### Error Handling

Custom `APIError` subclasses (`NotFoundError`, `ConflictError`, `BadRequestError`, `InternalError`) are automatically mapped to tRPC error codes via middleware. Unhandled errors are logged as fatal via Sentry.

### Dependency Injection

Services are built in `src/routes/build-services.ts` via plain constructor injection - no DI framework. The `createContext` function in `src/context.ts` assembles the full tRPC context (database, auth session, services) for each request.
